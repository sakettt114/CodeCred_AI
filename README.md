# 🤖 CodeCred AI | AI Skill Verification Tool
**CodeCred AI** is an AI-powered skill verification tool that compares a candidate’s **resume claims** with their **actual GitHub work**.

It analyzes repositories, dependencies, and coding patterns to identify real technical skills and highlight gaps between what someone claims and what their code demonstrates.

This makes it useful for:

- Recruiters validating developer skills  
- Students checking portfolio authenticity  
- Developers showcasing verified expertise
